This is frequently done through pedigree drawings (family trees). Unfortunately, due to the lack of easy to use pedigree drawing programs, this is usually done manually on a piece of paper. This makes pedigree drawings difficult to handle and also precludes any computational analysis. For example, you cannot click on an individual in a paper-drawn pedigree to open the associated database record.",

The resulting 6 billion data points have been deposited in a document database (MongoDB), that is available through a Web API.Using Map-Reduce techniques we have created a table where each human protein-coding gene is mapped to every PubMed article it appears in along with every term found in these papers. We have algorithms for aggregating multiple genes and for performing basic statistics for over-representation.",

To facilitate this process we require an interactive web front-end that allows intuitive querying across the various categories contained in our ‘little’ database as well as a visual presentation layer to convey the returned information and illustrate the connectivity between the discoveries.Ideally, we let the data speak for itself such as getting ranked recommendations via collaborative filtering or consensus via aggregations but also link back to the original publications to enable further in-depth studies.",

          "Indigenous Australians live 1–2 decades less than their non-Indigenous counterparts. Scabies affects 7 out of 10 Indigenous children at least once before their first birthday. What presents as an innocent itch can lead to heart and kidney failure and ultimately premature death. One Disease aims to eliminate scabies, because we believe no Australian should die of a preventable disease.   Currently, prevalence rates of scabies in Indigenous communities are established through screening events, or based on clinic presentation data. In screening events, a questionnaire developed from a sales app (DoForms) is used. In this, demographic information is preloaded onto the form, data is either typed or entered numerically during the screening, and the information is downloaded to an excel spreadsheet at the completion of the screening. This process has served the team well thus far, however there are limitations with accessibility due to the high level of English literacy and numeracy required to complete the form.",

Increased uptake would lead to increased screening, a better informed picture of the size of the scabies problem, and ultimately a more coordinated and comprehensive response to it. A visually based app would allow community members to take part in disease control efforts—effectively empowering them to crowd-source management of their own health. An open access app will also open the door for crowd-sourced surveillance of scabies if it is adopted for use by Government and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Clinics.",

            				 "The ‘omics’ era is upon us and genome sequencing is increasingly being integrated into clinical practice and used to develop personalised medicines. In searching for new genes responsible for a given disease, large cohorts of individuals will have their DNA sequenced and evaluated by qualified geneticists and bioinformaticians, to determine which genes are most likely to contribute to the disease state.",
                             "This can be particularly challenging, however, when exploring multigenic complex diseases such as autism or schizophrenia. After a series of analyses and filtering processes, sometimes >200 gene variants will be identified as possible candidates. Researchers must then decide the best candidate genes to move into their basic and translational research programs. Laboratory studies and disease models are costly in both time and funding, so it is essential to maximise our ability to prioritise candidate genes from the genomics pipeline.",
							 "Toward this goal, we are keen to develop a novel, user-friendly module that automates a series of sequence- and structure-based protein analyses, and systematic review of the literature. This will complement existing filters to better prioritise potential pathogenic gene variants. It will also enhance the ability of clinicians to predict disease outcome and trajectory.",
							 "Once this module is optimised and demonstrated to work well, it could be incorporated into almost any hospital/institute’s ‘omics’ pipeline."

          "The internet is a quagmire of health information, health misinformation and health disinformation. Public health information services, both in government and the broader civil society, are interested in communications activities which inform people of how to approach this information critically. Improving public critical thinking in the use of these information sources should increase the efficiency and outcomes of human/health-system interactions. Critical thinking is a verb. Top-down dissemination of information will not support this sort of learning. Developments in interactive journalism may be able to provide a way to impact upon public critical thinking.For example, a person who has been recently diagnosed with a mental illness might be interested in understanding the media around their diagnosis. A not-for-profit working to relieve mental illness might be interested in facilitating that conversation about media perceptions. In response to a disease outbreak, (such as ebola), an individual may be interested in understanding how the media representations shape our perceptions. An international relief agency may be interested in monitoring the response to inform their media campaigns for donations.",

          "The bottleneck in our research is the computational work involved in processing huge amounts of raw DNA sequence data. VLSCI researchers have developed a pipeline, Rubra, built on the Ruffus Python library, that allows us to process and analyse genomic data on the powerful VLSCI computing cluster. However this pipeline needs improvement to make it more generally usable and flexible. Within our research group, this will make Rubra accessible to biologists with limited programming skills, and allow us to easily customise our workflow for each new experiment. This will take us closer to understanding the genomic basis for climate adaptation, which in turn will let us identify the types of species most in need of protection under climate change."

Patient history information is usually stored in narrative text making longitudinal analysis difficult.
